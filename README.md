#Project - Sticky, Anchor ads

The project is, through a combination of JS and CSS, create the following two effects on ad units in a page (inside a ```html <div/>```).

###Sticky ads (Phase 1)
In order to improve viewability and ad performance, some publishers may choose to implement their ad units as “sticky ads.” A sticky ad is a persistent/fixed ad unit that stays visible while the user scrolls content on the page up or down.

###Anchor/overlay ads (Phase 2)
Anchor/overlay ads are mobile ads that stick to the edge of the user's screen and are easily dismissible.

###Notes:
We usually don’t have access to the full HTML of the page, so we need the tool to be as simple as possible to use, ideally we should only ask the website owner to add a few lines of code to the <head/> section.
